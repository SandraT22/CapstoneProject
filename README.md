## Project Proposal

<details>
<summary><strong>Purpose of the Project</strong></summary>
<ul>
<li>Personal Growth Goals:try new things that I haven't learned from Epicodus, such as visual studio instead of vs code, different API's, and building a full-stack project. 
<li>MVP goals: use React for the front end, C# for the back end, use google maps API to display haunted locations, create or use API to interact with google maps to display haunted locations, use css and bootstrap to style the page. 
<li>Stretch goals: Use the google maps API to display a route and work with the haunted location API to display the haunted locations along that route and/or enable the site to give directions to the selected locations.

<summary><strong>Project Research and activity log</strong></summary>
<ul>
<li>8:30am - 9am create github and create Readme to log activity. Start readme and brain storm what I need to do(mvp goals, what research I need to do)
<li> 9am to 10amResearch on how to write a project proposal 9/16: https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/research-proposal/#:~:text=Like%20your%20dissertation%20or%20thesis%2C%20the%20proposal%20will,Your%20supervisor%E2%80%99s%20name%204%20The%20institution%20and%20department
<li> 10am to 11am: Research on how to use C#, React and API's in one project (previewed in order to pick and find one to watch in its entirety): https://youtu.be/gpfP60KjmZU, https://youtu.be/NemyDIUcC64, https://youtu.be/2ayNDsqtjHs, 
<li> Break
<li> 11:15am to 12pm: Research on using azure (previewed in order to pick and find one to watch in its entirety): https://youtu.be/_TUaTNc8czU. Decided not to use azure. 
<li> Research on google maps api (overview in order to pick and find one to use): https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform, https://developers.google.com/maps,(need to make account in google cloud) https://youtu.be/9e-5QHpadi0, https://youtu.be/iP3DnhCUIsE
<li> 12pm to 12:30pm: To start building use https://youtu.be/gpfP60KjmZU. Start watching at 14 minutes. (skip the installation stuff and the setup for the API. Will probably have to look at this later if you end up having to build your own API for the haunted locations.) I think I want to try using visual studio 2019 instead of vscode.
<li> 12:30pm to 1:30pm: Research for haunted loications API: Will need geocoding to make it work with the google maps API? Google images for the background. 
<li> 1:30pm to 2:30pm: write out MVP goals (had previously just been thingking about them in order to know what I would need to research. After my research I have now made decisions and have a basic idea of what I will be able to do.), personal goals, and stretch goals. Start watching video at 14 minutes. I did not see ASP .net core when creating my project so I have to go in to modify it in the installer and needed to install an update. 
<li> 2:30pm - 2:45pm: Update the log.
