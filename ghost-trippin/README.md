## Project Proposal

<details>
<summary><strong>Purpose of the Project</strong></summary>
<ul>
<li>Personal Growth Goals:try new things that I haven't learned from Epicodus, such as visual studio instead of vs code, different API's, and building a full-stack project. 
<li>MVP goals: use React for the front end, C# for the back end, use google maps API to display haunted locations, create or use API to interact with google maps to display haunted locations, use css and bootstrap to style the page. 
<li>Stretch goals: Use the google maps API to display a route and work with the haunted location API to display the haunted locations along that route and/or enable the site to give directions to the selected locations.

<summary><strong>Project Research and activity log</strong></summary>
<ul>
<li>8:30am - 9am create github and create Readme to log activity. Start readme and brain storm what I need to do(mvp goals, what research I need to do)
<li> 9am to 10amResearch on how to write a project proposal 9/16: https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/research-proposal/#:~:text=Like%20your%20dissertation%20or%20thesis%2C%20the%20proposal%20will,Your%20supervisor%E2%80%99s%20name%204%20The%20institution%20and%20department
<li> 10am to 11am: Research on how to use C#, React and API's in one project (previewed in order to pick and find one to watch in its entirety): https://youtu.be/gpfP60KjmZU, https://youtu.be/NemyDIUcC64, https://youtu.be/2ayNDsqtjHs, 
<li> Break
<li> 11:15am to 12pm: Research on using azure (previewed in order to pick and find one to watch in its entirety): https://youtu.be/_TUaTNc8czU. Decided not to use azure. 
<li> Research on google maps api (overview in order to pick and find one to use): https://developers.google.com/maps/apis-by-platform, https://developers.google.com/maps,(need to make account in google cloud) https://youtu.be/9e-5QHpadi0, https://youtu.be/iP3DnhCUIsE
<li> 12pm to 12:30pm: To start building use https://youtu.be/gpfP60KjmZU. Start watching at 14 minutes. (skip the installation stuff and the setup for the API. Will probably have to look at this later if you end up having to build your own API for the haunted locations.) I think I want to try using visual studio 2019 instead of vscode.
<li> 12:30pm to 1:30pm: Research for haunted loications API: Will need geocoding to make it work with the google maps API? Google images for the background. 
<li> 1:30pm to 2:30pm: write out MVP goals (had previously just been thingking about them in order to know what I would need to research. After my research I have now made decisions and have a basic idea of what I will be able to do.), personal goals, and stretch goals. Start watching video at 14 minutes. I did not see ASP .net core when creating my project so I have to go in to modify it in the installer and needed to install an update. 
<li> 2:30pm - 2:45pm: Update the log. 
<li> break. 
<li>3pm to 4pm: created project in visual studio for C# backend. Created project in VSCode for react front end. Started trying to test a fetch call.

## Setup and Installation Requirements

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
