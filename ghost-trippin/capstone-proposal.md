<li>Personal Growth Goals:try new things that I haven't learned from Epicodus, such as visual studio instead of vs code, different API's, and building a full-stack project. 
<li>MVP goals: use React for the front end, C# for the back end, use google maps API to display haunted locations, create or use API to interact with google maps to display haunted locations, use css and bootstrap to style the page.
