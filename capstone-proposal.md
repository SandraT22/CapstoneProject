<summary><strong>Goals of the Project</strong></summary>
<ul>
<li>Personal Growth Goals:try new things that I haven't learned from Epicodus, such as visual studio instead of vs code, different API's, and building a full-stack project. 
<li>MVP goals: use React for the front end, C# for the back end, use google maps API to display haunted locations, create or use API to interact with google maps to display haunted locations, use css and bootstrap to style the page. 
<li>Stretch goals: Use the google maps API to display a route and work with the haunted location API to display the haunted locations along that route and/or enable the site to give directions to the selected locations.

<summary><strong>Project Inspiration</strong></summary>
The idea for this project came to me because my husband and I like to go on roadtrips whenever we have extra time. One of my favorite things to do, is check out haunted location to either explore or stay the night in. What usually happens is that I will watch spooky shows or read spooky articles and then look up any locations mentioned in these things on google maps. After I find them on google maps, I save them to a list and when I'm on a road trip I check to see if any of these haunted locations are near our road trip route. I figured it would come in handy for me to build a website that would help make this process a little easier for me.
